# API for App in main branch

Our repo will provide a Vietnamese handwriting recognition API using FastAPI. The models we use are two state-of-the-art models of scene text recognition, [CLIP4STR](https://github.com/VamosC/CLIP4STR) and [PARSeq](https://github.com/baudm/parseq).

To use our code we require you to have a GPU.

## Run demo
- Before running this code, I ask you to download the weight files of PARSeq and CLIP4STR.
<ul>
  <li>PARSeq: [](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eKAz6DLQNJiUSGNruj0UMPHJQmTWJTvE/view?usp=sharing). Put it in weight/parseq folder</li>
  <li>CLIP4STRL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eKAz6DLQNJiUSGNruj0UMPHJQmTWJTvE/view?usp=sharing and https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w-PJVEoXoJ1xBrOhteWawNrDXXZBCfSF/view?usp=sharing . Put them in weight/vl4str folder</li>
</ul>

- After that, let follow these steps:
